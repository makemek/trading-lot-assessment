					This demo allows you to enter a mathematical expression in terms of x and y. When you hit the calculate button, the demo will
					calculate the value of the expression over the x and y ranges provided and then plot the result as a surface.
					The graph can be zoomed in by scrolling with your mouse, and rotated by dragging around. Clicking on the graph will reveal the x, y and z values at that particular point.
				</p>

				<p>
					The table below lists which functions can be entered in the expression box.
				</p>

				<table class="table table-bordered">
					<tr>
						<th>Expression</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>sin(x)</td>
						<td>The sine of x in radians</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>cos(x)</td>
						<td>The cosine of x in radians</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>tan(x)</td>
						<td>The tangent of x in radians</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>asin(x), acos(x), atan(x)</td>
						<td>The inverse of the three trigonometric functions listed above</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>sqrt(x)</td>
						<td>The square root of x (for positive x only)</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>log(x)</td>
						<td>The natural logarithm of x</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>pow(x, y)</td>
						<td>The power of x to the y</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<p>
					You can also apply certain constraints/inequalities to the graph. If, for example, you wanted to show the funtion \(x^2\) - \(y^2\) but only in areas where \(x\) is greater than \(y\), you would enter "if (x > y, x*x - y*y)" in the expression box. You can also enter a third option which will be plotted if the first condition is not met - for example "if (x > y, x*x - y*y, x)" will plot \(x^2\) - \(y^2\) in all areas where \( x \) is greater than  \( y\), and \(x \) in all areas where x is <em>not</em> greater than y.
				</p>

				<p>
					The resolution slider can be used to increase the number of data points displayed on the graph, which gives a smoother final result, but since this needs more computational power, you may notice a slight decrease in frame rate when interacting with the graph.
				</p>

				<p>
					Every time you hit the "Calculate" button, the URL updates with your current settings meaning you can share a link directly to a graph of your choice without having to keep typing in the settings.
				</p>

				<p>
					Please note, if your surface includes complex numbers, only the real part will be plotted.
